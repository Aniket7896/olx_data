OLX_Data clone Server
Welcome to the OLX Clone Server repository! This server is the backbone of our OLX-inspired application, facilitating the seamless posting and browsing of listings.

Technologies Used:
Node.js: Our server is powered by Node.js, a fast and scalable runtime environment, allowing us to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

Express.js: Express.js serves as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the creation of robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.

MongoDB: MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system, efficiently stores and retrieves data, ensuring data integrity and security.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): We prioritize user authentication and security by employing JWT to create and validate tokens for user sessions.

Bcrypt: User passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt, providing an additional layer of security for user data.
